# Peter Pilgrim Digital CV

So you want to work with me in *2023* or beyond? Or perhaps, you are interested in a consultancy?

Let me introduce myself. I am Peter Pilgrim, a long standing software developer with achievements. 
I am a member of the [Java Champions](https://github.com/aalmiray/java-champions) (you have to be chosen by others for this honour, in the style of Italian-American crime fiction "Made").

Since October 1997, I have been writing Java programs professionally. Theseday, I still contribute to JDK 11 and hopefully JDK 17 applications, but my backgrounds goes way further back than that to C, C++, [Turbo C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_C%2B%2B), Fortran 77, Borland [Turbo Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_C%2B%2B), Standard Pascal, BBC BASIC, [Research Machines Limited BASIC 380Z](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Machines_380Z) and [6502 assembly language programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502#Assembly_language). You see I am learnt to program as a teenager in the 1980s.

I stopped contracting in the UK in 2021. I closed my UK LTD business, I did one 12 month fixed-term contract and I witnessed the death-knell UK contracting, because of the widely detested [Off-Payroll Worker Rules](https://www.contractoruk.com/news/0015004q_and_hmrc_now_force_ir35_payroll_working_rules.html) devastate the British contracting business. Of course, you all know about COVID-19 and now I prefer remote working (or least remote-first). 

In 2021, I become a Technical Consultant / Senior Manager at Cognizant and a permanent employee.

Did you know that I was the [Closing Keynote speaker for QCon London 2022](https://archive.qconlondon.com/london2022/speakers/peter-pilgrim)? This event was held at the prestiguous Queen Elizabeth II conference centre in Westminister. It was the first conference in-person after the pandemic that I met attendees, who wore masks inside the presentation rooms. I was so proud and surprised to be selected by the committee.


## Base Requirements

- **fully-remote** or **remote-first** (I'm based in Milton Keynes, England, UK)
- I enjoy working on a software products for public consumption
- I also enjoy building services for customers internally
- I very much like still technical coding although management seem to take a lot more of my time nowadays

My requirements for *2023* are:

   * 100% remote (1-2 days in office per month I can live with *remotee-first*)
   * Â£90K to Â£120K permanent base salary 
   * Contracting Â£600 per day Inside IR35 (Umbrella of my choice: Lucy's Clarity is my PSL)
   * Java 17 preferred, Java 11 LTS is very acceptable 
     (if you company is stuck on Java 8 JDK 1.8, sorry I am not prepared to contribute to another digital transformation over-promise-and-then-spectacularly-fail project)
   * Cloud-Native [a nice definition and explanation from Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/cloud-native/definition)
   * Prospective Client must be using Kubernetes to deploy software to the cloud
   * Prospective Client must be using Amazon Web Service (AWS), Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

So in a nutshell:

I am looking for a permanent base salary from Â£90K to Â£110K in 2023.
I will also consider contract roles for at least 6 months from Â£550 per day Inside IR35.
I stopped contracting December 2020 and I closed my Limited Company. 

PS: I will _NOT_ work for directly or indirectly for *gambling*, *betting* and *gaming* clients.

### I care about company culture and people

- The company that I want to work for or be involved with is *open*, *fair* and *transparent*
- I want to work in an open culture, where frequent feedback is appreciated, psychological safe and honest. 
- I want to see evidence of a values lived-in and also change. A company representative should be able to point to at least two critical improvements that occured within the last five years.
- I want to see diversity and less of the blame-culture that pervades less forthright businesses
- I want to see proactivity in ecological sustainability

In my opinion, disappointedly, I don't see many serious Black managers and people who look like me who have been promoted inside organisations, perhaps, because I spent several years as a contractor. So I will have more respect for companies that have evidence of a new approach. I will look at your executive deision makers on the web. 

I really do care about software technology and people who build the great products that we rely on everyday. In 2020, during the pandemic, I actually wrote, created and produced a non-technical online course on Vimeo called [How to improve your personal performance in Java technology?](https://vimeo.com/ondemand/personaltech) (not free Â£Â£Â£$$$). So excuse me and no offence intended if I refuse to join a "toxic culture" organisation.


### I care about code and quality

- I have alway enjoyed writing great software since I was really young. In those days, writing arcades  computer games stroked my ego a lot. 
- I then grew up and really saw that software with great quality can improve people's lives. 
- I respect junior developers who fight with me trying to understanding Dependency Injection and Spring Boot and also those flighty engineers who know more Ruby than I do and do hipster programming in VIM.
- On the other hand, I'm not a Scala zealot nor want to be involved with the *"one true way"* of writing any code.
- I experienced pair-programming and saw benefits of culture teams. I write tests and I want them to pass *green*
- I want to cut out the endless useless meetings of plans about plans, but like [General D. Eisenhower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower) [planning is the thing we should be all doing](https://www.eisenhowerlibrary.gov/eisenhowers/quotes). We should be organizing and improving the software architecture of our projects; constantly cleaning up and refactoring. 
- I want to take ownership of code with my team. 
- I also reach out to other teams for help, because I too experienced the impractical issues around "silo-team" thinking.
- I need to work in an environment and code-base that considers these things as necessary and valuable.
- I also want to work where we can remove unnecessary artefacts.


### I speak

I have been invited to speak at conferences and User Group Meet-ups.

I was so proud and honoured to be chosen to speak at [QCon London 2022](https://qconlondon.com/london2022/speakers/peter-pilgrim). I performed this non-technical talk called **Software Engineering Towards Sustainable Empathic Capacities**. It was the [Closing Keynote](https://qconlondon.com/london2022/keynote/closing-keynote) of the conference too.

I have spoken at plenty of conferences. Here is a short list.

  * JavaOne (San Francisco, USA)
  * Oracle CodeOne (San Francisco, USA)
  * QCon London 
  * JavaCro (Croatia)
  * Devoxx Belgium 
  * Devoxx UK
  * ACCU Conference
  * Silicon Valley User Group
  * Java Web User Group
  * Scala Exchange
 

Back in the day, I founded a London technoology group called the *Java Web User Group* (JAVAWUG), which ran between 2004 and 2011.

Are you still interested?

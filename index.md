# Peter Pilgrim Digital CV

So you want to work with me in 2022 or beyond? Or perhaps, you are interested in a consultancy?

Let me introduce myself. I am Peter Pilgrim, long standing software developer with achievements. 
I am a member of the Java Champions (you have to chosen by others for this honour, in the style of Italian-American crime fiction "Made").

Since October 1997, I have been writing Java programs professionally. Theseday, I still contribute to JDK 11 and hopefully JDK 17 applications, but my backgrounds goes way further back than that to C, C++,  Turbo C++, Fortran 77, Borland Turbo Pascal, Standard Pascal, BBC BASIC, Research Machines Limited BASIC and 6502 assembly language programming. You see I am learnt to program as a teenager in the 1980s.

I stopped contracting in the UK in 2021. I closed my UK LTD business, I did one fixed-term contractor and I saw the death-knell of Off-Payroll Worker Rules devastate the contracting business. Of course, you all know about COVID-19 and now I prefer mostly remote working. 

I am a Technical Consultant / Senior Manager at Cognizant and a permanent employee.

Did you know that I was the Closing Keynote speaker for QCon London 2022 in London? This event was held at the prestiguous Queen Elizabeth II conference centre in Westminister. It was the first conference in-person after the pandemic that I met attendee, who wore mask inside the presentation room. I was so proud and surprised to be selected by the committee.

   * minimum Â£100K base salary
   * Java 17 preferred, Java 11 LTS is very acceptable 
     (if you company is stuck on Java 8 JDK 1.8, sorry I am not prepared to contribute to another digital transformation over-promise-and-then-spectacularly-fail project)

I will _NOT_ work for directly or indirectly for gambling, betting and gaming clients.



### I care about company culture and people

- The company that I want to work for or be involved with is *open*, *fair* and *transparent*
- I want to work in an open culture, where frequent feedback is appreciated, psychological safe and honest. 
- I want to see evidence of a values lived-in and also change. A company representative should be able to point to at least two critical improvements that occured within the last five years.
- I want to see diversity and less of the blame-culture that pervades less forthright businesses
- I want to see proactivity in ecological sustainability

In my opinion, disappointedly, I don't see many serious Black managers and people who look like me who have been promoted inside organisations, perhaps, because I spent several years as a contractor. So I will have more respect for companies that have evidence of a new approach. I will look at your executive deision makers on the web. 

I really do care about software technologuy and people who build the great products that we rely on everyday. In 2020, during the pandemic, I actually wrote, created and produced a non-technical online course on Vimeo called [How to improve your personal performance in Java technology?](https://vimeo.com/ondemand/personaltech) (not free Â£Â£Â£$$$). So excuse me and I hope you are not offended if I refuse to join a "toxic culture" organisation.


### I care about code and quality

- I have alway enjoy writing great software since I was really young. In those days, writing arcadesgames stroked my ego alittle. 
- I then grew up and really saw that software with great quality can improve people's lives. 
- I respect junior developers who fight with me understanding dependency injection and Spring Boot and also those flighty engineers who know more Ruby than I do and do hipster programming in VIM.
- On the other hand, I not a Scala zeolet nor want to be involvedd with the *"one true way"* of writing any code.
- I experienced pair-programming and saw benefits of culture teams. I write tests and I want them to pass *green*; 
- I want to cut endless useless meetings of plans about plans, but like Eisenhower planning is the thing we should be all doing. We should be organizing and improving the software architecture of my project; cleaning up and refactoring. 
- I want to take ownership of code with my team. 
- I also reach out to other teams for helps, because I too experienced the impractical issues around "silo-team" thinking.
- I need to work in an environment and code-base that considers these things as necessary and valuable.
- I also want to work where we can remove unnecessary artefacts.


### I speak

I was so proud and honoured to be chosen to speak at [QCon London 2022](https://qconlondon.com/london2022/speakers/peter-pilgrim). I performed this non-technical talk called **Software Engineering Towards Sustainable Empathic Capacities**. It was the [Closing Keynote](https://qconlondon.com/london2022/keynote/closing-keynote) of the conference too.
